Note:

* I assumed that the fee percentages are decimal values with up to 4 digits after the decimal point, so I used `DECIMAL(5, 4)` as the data type for the `Fee_Percentage1` and `Fee_Percentage2` columns.
* I used `NULL` to represent the "N/A" values in the original data.
* You may need to adjust the data types and column names to fit your specific database schema and requirements.
